# EuroSkills Herning 2025 National Selection, Skill 17 (Web Development)

[Hungarian version](README.md)
## Round 1

Below, we share the most important information about the first round of this round.
### General Information
In this round, you will need to complete a web development task. You must complete the task independently, and your work should reflect your skills and knowledge.

Following the evaluation of the submitted task, we will conduct a personal interview with the top 10 competitors. Afterwards, we will select 6 competitors who will then compete against each other in a one-day semifinal. (The expected date of the semifinal is 2023.04.01, Saturday.)

#### Submission Method and Deadline:

You need to submit the task in two forms:

1.	Source code in a GitHub repo

	To submit the tasks, you need to share with us a GitHub repository (hereinafter referred to as repo) containing the source code of your solution. YYY is the three-digit personal code that was sent to you by email. If you have not used GitHub before, register an account at https://github.com, then create a private repo named es2025-s17-r1-YYY, where YYY is the three-digit number you received from us by email.

	Then you need to share the repo containing your solution with us. Use our `skillsithu` GitHub identifier for this.

2.	Publishing the finished website (deploy) using Netlify

	a.	Netlify is a service that can be used for free to share static websites with the public. The service works by connecting a web application created on Netlify with a GIT repo (in our case, the GitHub repo created for the round's task). When you push a change to the repo, Netlify creates a new build based on this and immediately publishes it to the public address associated with the app. If you are only using native HTML/CSS/JavaScript, the build (the package prepared for publishing) will essentially match the source code. If you get stuck, feel free to contact us for guidance! If your application is made with a framework (e.g., React), look into how you can publish your application on Netlify in the simplest way.

	b.	Register an identifier on Netlify (https://www.netlify.com/), create a new app for your website (App New Site > Import an existing project), connect the app with your GitHub repo, then choose any free hostname you like.
 
	c.	Write the chosen hostname (where your website will be accessible) in the first line of the repo's README file. Write your given identifier in the second line, and your name in the third.

#### The Task

The description of the task is in this repo, in the file [es2025-s17-hu-r1.md](es2025-s17-hu-r1.md). The task is divided into three phases. In order for your solution to be evaluated, you must complete at least the first phase. You do not necessarily have to complete all the phases to pass. If you complete the first phase, you can increase your chances of reaching the semi-finals by completing all or part of the second phase. Only start the third phase once you have completed the first two phases in their entirety. 

#### Deadline

The final deadline for completing the tasks is: **2024.02.27., Tuesday, midnight**

We will consider as submitted whatever is found in your repo and on your Netlify page at the above time.
